      <header>Free or PRO?</header>
      <article>
      <p>Learning on SoloLearn is completely free. Our apps are available on Android, iOS, and Web. We do have a premium subscription available called SoloLearn PRO. With a SoloLearn PRO subscription, you will have an ad-free experience with access to a more customized experience that includes setting learning goals and access to personalized activity insights. On the social front, you can see who’s viewed your profile and who’s learning nearby. We add new features regularly to improve the PRO experience further. For now, SoloLearn PRO is available only for Android users. We expect the iOS version to launch in the next month or two.</p>
     
    <header>How do I upgrade to the PRO account?</header>

<p>To subscribe to SoloLearn PRO, tap on the right top menu and select SoloLearn PRO. Choose one of the options available (Monthly or Yearly), and follow the instructions. The cost of a Monthly subscription is $4.99/month, and the cost of the Yearly plan is $3.99/month.</p>

<header>What happens when my subscription expires?</header>

<p>When your subscription expires, your access will revert to the free account privileges and you will no longer be able to use your PRO account. If you wish to continue using your PRO account, simply start a new monthly or annual subscription. </p>

<header>How do I cancel my PRO subscription?</header>

<p>You can cancel your PRO subscription anytime you want. Just open the app, go to Settings -> Manage subscriptions, and follow the instructions. After cancelling your subscription, you will be able to use SoloLearn PRO for the remaining days that you have already paid for. When your subscription expires, it will not be renewed. Please note that subscription cancellations cannot be undone, though you can always start a new subscription whenever you want. More information can be found on Google Payments' page.</p>
